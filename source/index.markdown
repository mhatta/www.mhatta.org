# About myself

My name is Masayuki Hatta (Masayuki is the [given name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name), Hatta is the [family name](http://en.wikipedia.org/Family_name)). I was born in [July 31th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_31), [1979](http://en.wikipedia.org/1979), and currently live with my family in the suburb of [Tokyo](http://en.wikipedia.org/Tokyo), [Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/Japan).  See also [my bio entry in Japanese Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AB%E7%94%B0%E7%9C%9F%E8%A1%8C).

I was one of government-funded [AFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFS_Intercultural_Programs) exchange students, and lived in [Hopewell Junction, NY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopewell_Junction,_New_York), USA in 1997-8.

I received a BA in economics (2002) and a MA in economics from the [University of Tokyo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo) (2004). I was pursuing my Ph.D. in economics at Graduate School of Economics, the University of Tokyo between 2004-2009. After serving as a research fellow at [Institute of Intellectual Property](http://www.iip.or.jp/e/index.html) of Japan(2010-2011), now I am an assistant professor of economics at [Surugadai University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surugadai_University) in [Hanno, Saitama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann%C5%8D,_Saitama). I am also a visiting research fellow at [Global Comunication Centor(GLOCOM)](http://www.glocom.ac.jp/e/), [International University of Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_University_of_Japan).

My research field is generally called [organizational studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_studies), and I am particularly interested in the process of collaborative knowledge development. One of my main arena is so-called [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software development process and licensing schemes. I am also interested in the [economic analysis of law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_economics), especially its application to the system of intellectual property laws such as copyright or patent. Recently, I am researching so-called [hacktivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism) and its impact on our society.
